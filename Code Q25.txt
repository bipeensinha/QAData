SELECT clarity,
       -- so, how do we define the most expensive clarity:
       --
       -- is it max price, total price, or average price?
       MAX(price) AS Max_Price,
       SUM(price) AS Total_Sales,
       AVG(price) AS Avg_Price1,
       --
       -- is it total amount of diamonds sold, or total carats sold?
       COUNT(price)              AS Diamonds_Sold,
       ROUND(SUM(carat), 0)      AS Carats_Sold,
       SUM(price) / COUNT(price) AS Avg_Price2,
       --
       -- or maybe it is the average [price per carat],
       -- then there are two ways of calculating it:
       ROUND(AVG(price/carat),        0) AS Price_Per_Carat1,
       ROUND(SUM(price) / SUM(carat), 0) AS Price_Per_Carat2
FROM Diamonds
GROUP BY clarity
ORDER BY 9 DESC -- order by 3,4 or 8,9
--
-- Probably, the most sensible choice is to use Price_Per_Carat2 -
-- if you order the output by this field, all the clarity categories
-- appear in the natural order (except of VVS1)
--
-- However, in PowerBI, we will implement two fields:
-- * column 8 (Price_Per_Carat1) using calculated column:
--            price_per_carat = ROUND([price] / [carat], 0)
--            This formula calculates price/carat expression for each record,
--            and then visual takes average for each clarity category
-- * column 9 (Price_Per_Carat2) using Quick Measure,
--            which will be calculated separately for each clarity category
